#Lesson Learned
I learned that I can't use "this." on a static field. I'm sure we went over that in class but now that I've tried it a few times and kept getting an error message I'm sure it'll stick. I also learned when I was trying to get the highest rating it was easier to compare ratings by creating a new truck. My first thought was to compare ratings by an integer variable.
